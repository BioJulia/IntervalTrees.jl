Package maintainers also have <strong>push</strong> (but not <strong>admin</strong>) access to all other code packages in the BioJulia ecosystem.</p><p>This allows for a community spirit where maintainers who are dedicated primarily to other packages may step in to help other maintainers to resolve a PR or issue. As such, newer maintainers and researchers contributing a package to the BioJulia ecosystem can rest assured help will always be at hand from our community.</p><p>However, if you are a maintainer stepping in to help the maintainer(s) dedicated to another package, please respect them by first offering to step in and help, before changing anything. Secondly, ask them before doing advanced and potentially destructive git operations e.g forcing pushes to branches (especially master), or re-writing history of branches. Please defer to the judgement of the maintainers dedicated in the README of the package.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="BioJulia-Administrators-1" href="#BioJulia-Administrators-1">BioJulia Administrators</a></h3><p>BioJulia has a select group of members in an Admin team. This team has administrative access to all repositories in the BioJulia project.</p><p>The admin team is expected to:</p><ol><li>Respond and resolve any disputes between any two BioJulia contributors.</li><li>Act as mentors to all other BioJulia maintainers.</li><li>Assist maintainers in the upkeep of packages when requested. Especially when more difficult re-bases and history manipulation are required.</li><li>Some administrators maintain the BioJulia infrastructure. This includes being responsible for the accounts and billing of any platforms used by BioJulia, and the maintenance of any hardware like servers owned and used by BioJulia.</li></ol><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Etiquette-and-conduct-1" href="#Etiquette-and-conduct-1">Etiquette and conduct</a></h3><p>BioJulia outlines a <a href="CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html">statement of etiquette and conduct</a> that all members and contributors are expected to uphold. Please take the time to read and understand this statement.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Package-conventions-1" href="#Package-conventions-1">Package conventions</a></h3><p>First, be familiar with the official julia documentation on:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/">Packages</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/#Package-Development-1">Package Development</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/modules/">Modules</a></li></ul><p>Package names should be a simple and self explanatory as possible, avoiding unneeded acronyms.</p><p>Packages introducing some key type or method/algorithm should be named accordingly.</p><p>For example, the BioJulia package introducing biological sequence types and functionality to process sequence data is called &quot;BioSequences&quot;. GitHub repository names of BioJulia packages should end in <code>.jl</code>, even though the package name itself does not. i.e. &quot;BioSequences&quot; is the name of the package, and the name of its GitHub repository is &quot;BioSequences.jl&quot;.</p><p>Considerate and simple naming greatly assists people in finding the kind of package or functionality they are looking for.</p><p>File names of files containing julia code in packages should end in <code>.jl</code>.</p><p>All user facing types and functions (i.e. all types and functions exported from the module of a package), should be documented. Documentation regarding specific implementation details that aren&#39;t relevant to users should be in the form of comments. Please <em>DO</em> comment liberally for complex pieces of code!</p><p>We use <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a>, to generate user and developer documentation and host it on the web. The source markdown files for such manuals is kept in the <code>docs/src/</code> folder of each BioJulia package/repository.</p><p>The code in all BioJulia packages is unit tested. Such tests should be organized into contexts, and into separate files based on module.</p><p>Files for tests for a module go into an appropriately named folder, within the <code>test</code> folder in the git repo.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="How-can-I-contribute?-1" href="#How-can-I-contribute?-1">How can I contribute?</a></h2><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Reporting-Bugs-1" href="#Reporting-Bugs-1">Reporting Bugs</a></h3><p>Here we show you how to submit a bug report for a BioJulia repository.

For information on how to do this, see this section of the julia <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/#Package-Development-1">documentation</a>.</p><p>Before you start working on code, it is often a good idea to open an enhancement <a href="#suggest-an-enhancement">suggestion</a></p><p>Once you decide to start working on code, the first thing you should do is make yourself an account on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. The chances are you already have one if you&#39;ve done coding before and wanted to make any scripts or software from a science project public.</p><p>The first step to contributing is to find the <a href="https://github.com/BioJulia">BioJulia repository</a> for the package. Hit the &#39;Fork&#39; button on the repositories page to create a forked copy of the package for your own Github account. This is your blank slate to work on, and will ensure your work and experiments won&#39;t hinder other users of the released and stable package.</p><p>From there you can clone your fork of the package and work on it on your machine using git. Here&#39;s an example of cloning, assuming you already forked the BioJulia package &quot;BioSequences.jl&quot;:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/&lt;YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE&gt;/BioSequences.jl.git</code></pre><p>Git will download or &quot;clone&quot; your fork and put it in a folder called BioSequences.jl it creates in your current directory.</p><p>It is beyond the scope of this document to describe good git and github use in more specific detail, as the folks at Git and GitHub have already done that wonderfully on their own sites. If you have additional questions, simply ping a BioJulia member or the <a href="https://gitter.im/BioJulia/Bio.jl">BioJulia Gitter</a>.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="How-to-make-(good)-code-contributions-and-new-Pull-Requests-1" href="#How-to-make-(good)-code-contributions-and-new-Pull-Requests-1">How to make (good) code contributions and new Pull-Requests</a></h4><ol><li><p><strong>In your code changes</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Branch properly!</strong></p><ul><li>If you are making a bug-fix, then you need to checkout your bug-fix branch from the last release tag.</li><li>If you are making a feature addition or other enhancement, checkout your branch from master.</li><li>See <a href="#a-suggested-branching-model">here</a> for more information (or ask a package maintainer :smile:).</li></ul></li><li><p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/style-guide/">julia style guide</a>.</p></li><li><p>Follow the <a href="#additional-julia-code-style-suggestions">additional style suggestions</a>.</p></li><li><p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/performance-tips/">julia performance tips</a>.</p></li><li><p>Update and add docstrings for new code, consistent with the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/documentation/">documentation styleguide</a>.</p></li><li><p>Update information in the documentation located in the <code>docs/src/</code> folder of the package/repository if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that unit tests have been added which cover your code changes.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that you have added an entry to the <code>[UNRELEASED]</code> section of the manually curated <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> file for the package.

In order to become an admin, one does not necessarily have to contribute large amounts of code to the project. Rather the decision to on-board a member to an admin position requires a history of using and contributing to BioJulia, and a positive interaction and involvement with the community. Any BioJulia member fulfilling this, may offer to take on this <a href="#biojulia-administrators">responsibility</a>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Styleguides-1" href="#Styleguides-1">Styleguides</a></h2><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Git-Commit-messages-1" href="#Git-Commit-messages-1">Git Commit messages</a></h3><ul><li>Use the present tense (&quot;Add feature&quot; not &quot;Added feature&quot;).</li><li>Use the imperative mood (&quot;Move cursor to...&quot; not &quot;Moves cursor to...&quot;).</li><li>Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.</li><li>Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.</li><li>Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:<ul><li>:art: <code>:art:</code> when improving the format/structure of the code</li><li>:racehorse: <code>:racehorse:</code> when improving performance</li><li>:memo: <code>:memo:</code> when writing docs</li><li>:penguin: <code>:penguin:</code> when fixing something on Linux</li><li>:apple: <code>:apple:</code> when fixing something on macOS</li><li>:checkered<em>flag: `:checkered</em>flag:` when fixing something on Windows</li><li>:bug: <code>:bug:</code> when fixing a bug</li><li>:fire: <code>:fire:</code> when removing code or files</li><li>:green<em>heart: `:green</em>heart:` when fixing the CI build</li><li>:white<em>check</em>mark: <code>:white_check_mark:</code> when adding tests</li><li>:arrow<em>up: `:arrow</em>up:` when upgrading dependencies</li><li>:arrow<em>down: `:arrow</em>down:` when downgrading dependencies</li><li>:exclamation: <code>:exclamation:</code> when removing warnings or depreciations</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Additional-julia-style-suggestions-1" href="#Additional-julia-style-suggestions-1">Additional julia style suggestions</a></h3><ul><li><p>Source code files should have the following style of header:</p><pre><code class="language-julia"># Title

Be aware that functions in julia implicitly return the the result of the last expression in the function, so plain <code>return</code> should be used to indicate that the function returns <code>nothing</code>.</p></li><li><p>Type names are camel case, with the first letter capitalized. E.g. <code>SomeVeryUsefulType</code>.</p></li><li><p>Module names should be camel case.</p></li><li><p>Separate logical blocks of code with one blank line. Although it is common and acceptable for short single-line functions to be defined together on consecutive lines with no blank lines between them.</p></li><li><p>Function names, apart from constructors, are all lowercase. Include underscores between words only if the name would be hard to read without. E.g.  <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, <code>find_letter</code> <code>find_last_digit</code>. It is good to separate concepts in a name with a <code>_</code>.</p></li><li><p>Generally try to keep lines below 100-columns, unless splitting a long line onto multiple lines makes it harder to read.</p></li><li><p>Files that declare modules should only declare the module, and import any modules that it requires. Any subsequent significant code should be included from separate files. E.g.</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-julia">module AwesomeFeatures

using IntervalsTrees, JSON

include(&quot;feature1.jl&quot;)
include(&quot;feature2.jl&quot;)

end</code></pre><ul><li><p>Files that declare modules should have the same name name of the module. E.g the module <code>SomeModule</code> is declared under the file <code>SomeModule.jl</code>.</p></li><li><p>When extending method definitions, define the methods with a module name prefix. E.g.</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-julia">function Base.start(iter::YourType)
  ...
end

Base.done(iter::YourType, state) = ...</code></pre><ul><li>Functions that get or set variables in a struct should not be prefixed with &#39;get&#39; or &#39;set&#39;. The getter should be named for the variable it gets, and the setter should have the same name as the getter, with the suffix <code>!</code>. For example, for the variable <code>names</code>:</li></ul><pre><code class="language-julia">name(node) # get node name
name!(node, &quot;somename&quot;) # set node name</code></pre><ul><li>When using conditional branching, if code is statement-like, an if-else block should be used. However if the code is expression-like then julia&#39;s ternary operator should be used.<pre><code class="language-julia">matches == sketchlen ? 1.0 : matches / (2 * sketchlen - matches)</code></pre>Some simple checks and expressions are also expressed using the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> operators instead of if-else syntax. For example:<pre><code class="language-julia">isvalid(foo) || throw(ArgumentError(&quot;$foo is not valid&quot;))</code></pre></li></ul><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Additional-Notes-1" href="#Additional-Notes-1">Additional Notes</a></h2><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="A-suggested-branching-model-1" href="#A-suggested-branching-model-1">A suggested branching model</a></h3><p>If you are a <a href="#biojulia-package-maintainers">dedicated maintainer</a> on a BioJulia package, you may be wondering which branching model to choose for development and maintenance of your code.</p><p>If you are a contributor, knowing the branching model of a package may help you work more smoothly with the maintainer of the package.</p><p>There are several options available, including git-flow.</p><p>Below is a recommended branching model for your repo, but it is only a suggestion. What is best for you as the <a href="#biojulia-package-maintainers">dedicated maintainer(s)</a>, is best for <em>you</em>.</p><p>The model below is a brief summary of the <a href="http://endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow">&#39;OneFlow model&#39;</a>.

These temporary branches are used as a convenience to share code with other developers and as a backup measure. They are always removed once the changes present on them are added to master.</p></li><li><p>Features are integrated onto the master branch primarily in a way which keeps the history linear and simple. A good compromise to the rebase vs. merge commit debate for this step is to first do an interactive rebase of the feature branch on master, and then do a non-fast-forward merge. Github now does squashed commits when merging a PR and this is fine too.</p></li></ol><p><em>Feature Example:</em></p><pre><code class="language-sh">git checkout -b feature/my-feature master

It branches off from <code>master</code> at the point that you decided <code>master</code> has all the necessary features. This is not necessarily the tip of the <code>master</code> branch.</p></li><li><p>From then on new work, aimed for the <em>next</em> release, is pushed to <code>master</code> as always, and any necessary changes for the <em>current</em> release are pushed to the release branch. Once the release is ready, you tag the top of the release branch.</p></li><li><p>Once the release is ready, tag the top of the release branch with a version number. Then do a typical merge of the release branch into <code>master</code>. Any changes that were made during the release will now be part of <code>master</code>.
