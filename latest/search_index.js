    "text": "The basic data structure implemented in this package is IntervalTree{K, V}, which stores intervals of type V, that have start and end positions of type K.IntervalMap{K, V} is a typealias for IntervalTree{K, IntervalValue{K, V}} to simplify associating data of type V with intervals.Multiple data structures are refered to as \"interval trees\". What\'s implemented here is the data structure described in the Cormen, et al. \"Algorithms\" book, or what\'s refered to as an augmented tree in the wikipedia article. This sort of data structure is just an balanced search tree augmented with a field to keep track of the maximum interval end point in that node\'s subtree.Many operations over two or more sets of intervals can be most efficiently implemented by jointly iterating over the sets in order. For example, finding all the intersecting intervals in two sets S and T can be implemented similarly to the merge function in mergesort in O(n+m) time.Thus a general purpose data structure should be optimized for fast in-order iteration while efficiently supporting other operations like insertion, deletion, and single intersection tests. A B+-tree is nicely suited to the task. Since all the intervals and values are stored in contiguous memory in the leaf nodes, and the leaf nodes augmented with sibling pointers, in-order traversal is exceedingly efficient compared to other balanced search trees, while other operations are comparable in performance."

    "text": "In order to provide the best possible experience for new and existing users of Julia from the life-sciences, a little bit of structure and organization is necessary.Each package is dedicated to introducing a specific data type or algorithm, or dealing with a specific biological problem or pipeline.Whilst there are some \"meta-packages\" such as Bio.jl, which bundle individual packages together for convenience of installation and use, most of the BioJulia software ecosystem is quite decentralized.Therefore, it made sense that maintenance of the packages should also be fairly decentralized, to achieve this, we created the role of a \"Package Maintainer\".The maintainer(s) for a given package are listed in the packages README.md file.The maintainers of a package are responsible for the following aspects of the package they maintain.Deciding the branching model used and how branches are protected.\nReviewing pull requests, and issues for that package.\nTo tag releases of a package at suitable points in the lifetime of the package.\nTo be considerate and of assistance to new contributors, new community members and new maintainers.\nTo report potential incidents of antisocial to a BioJulia admin member.See HERE for extra guidance and suggestions on branching models and tagging releases.Package maintainers hold admin level access for any package(s) for which they are listed as maintainer, and so new contributors to BioJulia should rest assured they will not be \'giving up\' any package they transfer to BioJulia, they shall remain that package\'s administrator. Package maintainers also have push (but not admin) access to all other code packages in the BioJulia ecosystem.This allows for a community spirit where maintainers who are dedicated primarily to other packages may step in to help other maintainers to resolve a PR or issue. As such, newer maintainers and researchers contributing a package to the BioJulia ecosystem can rest assured help will always be at hand from our community.However, if you are a maintainer stepping in to help the maintainer(s) dedicated to another package, please respect them by first offering to step in and help, before changing anything. Secondly, ask them before doing advanced and potentially destructive git operations e.g forcing pushes to branches (especially master), or re-writing history of branches. Please defer to the judgement of the maintainers dedicated in the README of the package."

GitHub repository names of BioJulia packages should end in .jl, even though the package name itself does not. i.e. \"BioSequences\" is the name of the package, and the name of its GitHub repository is \"BioSequences.jl\".Considerate and simple naming greatly assists people in finding the kind of package or functionality they are looking for.File names of files containing julia code in packages should end in .jl.All user facing types and functions (i.e. all types and functions exported from the module of a package), should be documented. Documentation regarding specific implementation details that aren\'t relevant to users should be in the form of comments. Please DO comment liberally for complex pieces of code!We use Documenter.jl, to generate user and developer documentation and host it on the web. The source markdown files for such manuals is kept in the docs/src/ folder of each BioJulia package/repository.The code in all BioJulia packages is unit tested. Such tests should be organized into contexts, and into separate files based on module.Files for tests for a module go into an appropriately named folder, within the test folder in the git repo."

Hit the \'Fork\' button on the repositories page to create a forked copy of the package for your own Github account.

Here\'s an example of cloning, assuming you already forked the BioJulia package \"BioSequences.jl\":git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE>/BioSequences.jl.gitGit will download or \"clone\" your fork and put it in a folder called BioSequences.jl it creates in your current directory.It is beyond the scope of this document to describe good git and github use in more specific detail, as the folks at Git and GitHub have already done that wonderfully on their own sites.

    "text": "If you have written a package, and would like to have it listed under - and endorsed by - the BioJulia organization, you\'re agreeing to the following:Allowing BioJulia to have joint ownership of the package. This is so that the members can help you review and merge pull requests and other contributions, and also help you to develop new features. This policy ensures that you (as the package author and current maintainer) will have good support in maintaining your package to the highest possible quality.\nGo through a joint review/decision on a suitable package name. This usually the original package name. However, package authors may be asked to rename their package to something more official and discoverable (by search engines and such) if it is contentious or non-standard.To submit your package, follow these steps:Introduce yourself and your package on the BioJulia Gitter channel.\nAt this point maintainers will reach out to mentor and vouch for you and your package. They will:\nDiscuss with you a suitable name.\nHelp you ensure the the package is up to standard, and meets the code and contribution guidelines described on this site.\nAdd you to the BioJulia organisation if you wish to become a BioJulia maintainer.\nTransfer ownership of the package."

    "text": "Members of the admin team have often been contributing to BioJulia for a long time, and may even be founders present at the inception of the project. In order to become an admin, one does not necessarily have to contribute large amounts of code to the project. Rather the decision to on-board a member to an admin position requires a history of using and contributing to BioJulia, and a positive interaction and involvement with the community. Any BioJulia member fulfilling this, may offer to take on this responsibility."

    "text": "Source code files should have the following style of header:\n# Title\n# =====\n#\n# Short description.\n#\n# [Long description (optional)]\n#\n# This file is a part of BioJulia. License is MIT: <link to the license file>\nIndent with 4 spaces.\nFor functions that are not a single expression, it is preferred to use an explicit return. Be aware that functions in julia implicitly return the the result of the last expression in the function, so plain return should be used to indicate that the function returns nothing.\nType names are camel case, with the first letter capitalized. E.g. SomeVeryUsefulType.\nModule names should be camel case.\nSeparate logical blocks of code with one blank line. Although it is common and acceptable for short single-line functions to be defined together on consecutive lines with no blank lines between them.\nFunction names, apart from constructors, are all lowercase. Include underscores between words only if the name would be hard to read without. E.g.  start, stop, find_letter find_last_digit. It is good to separate concepts in a name with a _.\nGenerally try to keep lines below 100-columns, unless splitting a long line onto multiple lines makes it harder to read.\nFiles that declare modules should only declare the module, and import any modules that it requires. Any subsequent significant code should be included from separate files. E.g.module AwesomeFeatures\n\nusing IntervalsTrees, JSON\n\ninclude(\"feature1.jl\")\ninclude(\"feature2.jl\")\n\nendFiles that declare modules should have the same name name of the module. E.g the module SomeModule is declared under the file SomeModule.jl.\nWhen extending method definitions, define the methods with a module name prefix. E.g.function Base.start(iter::YourType)\n  ...\nend\n\nBase.done(iter::YourType, state) = ...Functions that get or set variables in a struct should not be prefixed with \'get\' or \'set\'. The getter should be named for the variable it gets, and the setter should have the same name as the getter, with the suffix !. For example, for the variable names:name(node) # get node name\nname!(node, \"somename\") # set node nameWhen using conditional branching, if code is statement-like, an if-else block should be used. However if the code is expression-like then julia\'s ternary operator should be used.\nmatches == sketchlen ? 1.0 : matches / (2 * sketchlen - matches)\nSome simple checks and expressions are also expressed using the && or || operators instead of if-else syntax. For example:\nisvalid(foo) || throw(ArgumentError(\"$foo is not valid\"))"

What is best for you as the dedicated maintainer(s), is best for you.The model below is a brief summary of the \'OneFlow model\'. We describe it in summary here for convenience, but we recommend you check out the blog article as a lot more justification and reasoning is presented on why this model is the way it is."

    "text": "There is only one main branch - you can call it anything, but usually it\'s called master.\nUse temporary branches for features, releases, and bug-fixes. These temporary branches are used as a convenience to share code with other developers and as a backup measure. They are always removed once the changes present on them are added to master.\nFeatures are integrated onto the master branch primarily in a way which keeps the history linear and simple. A good compromise to the rebase vs. merge commit debate for this step is to first do an interactive rebase of the feature branch on master, and then do a non-fast-forward merge. Github now does squashed commits when merging a PR and this is fine too.Feature Example:git checkout -b feature/my-feature master\n\n... Make commits to feature/my-feature to finish the feature ...\n\ngit rebase -i master\ngit checkout master\ngit merge --no-ff feature/my-feature\ngit push origin master\ngit branch -d feature/my-feature"

    "text": "You create a new branch for a new release. It branches off from master at the point that you decided master has all the necessary features. This is not necessarily the tip of the master branch.\nFrom then on new work, aimed for the next release, is pushed to master as always, and any necessary changes for the current release are pushed to the release branch. Once the release is ready, you tag the top of the release branch.\nOnce the release is ready, tag the top of the release branch with a version number. Then do a typical merge of the release branch into master. Any changes that were made during the release will now be part of master. Delete the release branch.Release Example:git checkout -b release/2.3.0 9efc5d\n\n... Make commits to release/2.3.0 to finish the release ...\n\ngit tag 2.3.0\ngit checkout master\ngit merge release/2.3.0\ngit push --tags origin master\ngit branch -d release/2.3.0\ngit push origin :release/2.3.0Do your pushes, and go to GitHub to make your release available."

Add commits which fix the problem ...\n\ngit tag 2.3.1\ngit checkout master\ngit merge hotfix/2.3.1\ngit push --tags origin master\ngit branch -d hotfix/2.3.1IMPORTANT: There is one special case when finishing a hot-fix branch. If a release branch has already been cut in preparation for the next release before the hot-fix was finished, you need to merge the hot-fix branch not to master, but to that release branch."

    "text": "Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive or fun community. Members of the BioJulia community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the BioJulia community.Please do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour is not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:Violent threats or language directed against another person.\nPrejudiced, bigoted, or intolerant, jokes and language.\nPosting sexually explicit or violent material.\nPosting (or threatening to post) other people\'s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\nPersonal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.\nRepeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and this community is unlikely to be any exception! It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesnâ€™t mean that theyâ€™re wrong. Donâ€™t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesnâ€™t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.Assume the person you have a disagreement with really does want the best for BioJulia, just as you do. Therefore, if you are ever unsure what the meaning or tone of a comment may be, in the first instance, assume your fellow BioJulia member is acting in good faith, this may well be a mistake in communication (with the scientific community as diverse as it is, such mis-steps are likely!). If you are comfortable doing so, ask them to clarify what they mean or to rephrase their point. If you don\'t feel comfortable doing this, or if it is clear the behaviour is hostile and not acceptable, please report it (see next section)."
